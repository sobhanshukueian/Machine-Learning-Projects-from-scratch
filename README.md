## Naive Bayes
### Bayes Theorem
Bayes’ Theorem finds the probability of an event occurring given the probability of another event that has already occurred. Bayes’ theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:

### Naive assumption
If any two events A and B are independent, then:
#### P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)
We know our features are independant, So we split evidence into the independent parts.
